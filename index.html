                <p>We teamed up with The Boston Globe, Filament Group, and Ethan Marcotte to build a newspaper website for the 21st century. The brand new home of the Boston Globe was designed with the reader foremost in mind and is optimized so it can be read on anything — Android, iPad, laptop, Kindle, 27” iMac, Blackberry, you name it. The site uses a technique called responsive design to serve the same content to everyone while making specific adaptations based on size (How wide is the viewing area?) and capability (Is it touch screen?). Ethan, Scott Jehl, and Filament really pioneered this approach, literally writing the book on the subject. For more about how we arrived at this approach, read our blog post. We wrote two other blog posts related to this project, one about how to approach a responsive design and another about how we found the look and feel.</p>

                <h3>Layouts that adapt to the news and things</h3>
                <p>Most news sites have a single presentation that rarely deviates. On a daily basis, the news must conform to the homepage layout. We always thought it should be the other way around. The layout should change to reflect the moment in time, like a print newspaper front page. We worked with Miranda Mulligan and editors at The Globe to design several flexible approaches that anticipate different photos sizes and news hierarchies.</p>

                <h3>Elegant typography and bold visuals</h3>
                <p>The Sunday Magazine section showcases some of the hallmarks of the new design: Big, bold photos and elegant typography. The site uses Miller, a custom-drawn typeface that's an important part of The Globe brand. The fonts come from our friends (and Fort Point neighbors) at The Font Bureau.</p>
